<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
This is a broad overview of this learning path: 
1. Cyber Defence Frameworks, learning what is involved with being a SOC Analyst and the basic principles behind the role. 
2. Cyber Threat Intelligence, this series of rooms introduced CTI and various frameworks used to share intelligence.
3. Network Security and Traffic Analysis, introduced the essential concepts of network security and traffic analysis to assist with traffic/packet analysis. 
4. Endpoint Security Monitoring, tackled the following; endpoint security fundamentals, endpoint logging and monitoring, and endpoint log analysis. 
5. Security Information and Event Management, how SIEM's work and the capabilities it provides for network visibility, log sources, and log ingestion. 
6. Digital Forensics and Incident Response, basic DFIR concepts and the tools available for use in the incident response process. 
7. Phishing, looking at the components involved with sending emails across the internet and how to analyse email headers.

Each room has a series of 'Tasks' that are required to be completed. Some only require to be read, while others are more in depth and require practice to obtain the answers and move on to the next question. <br/>
